# OpenMRS Billing Module

The OpenMRS Billing Module is a comprehensive billing and payment management system for OpenMRS. It provides a complete solution for healthcare facilities to manage patient billing, process payments, generate receipts, and track financial transactions.

## Key Features

### Bill Management

Create and manage patient bills with multiple line items, track bills through various states (draft, posted, adjusted), and handle bill adjustments with full audit trail and refunds with proper authorization.

### Payment Processing

Process payments using multiple payment modes (cash, insurance, mobile money, credit/debit cards, custom modes) with support for partial payments, payment attributes, and automatic change calculation.

### Receipt Generation

Generate and print receipts using configurable Jasper Report templates with sequential or custom receipt numbering, configurable logos, and reprint capabilities with privilege controls.

### Cash Point Management

Manage multiple cashier stations/locations with cash point assignment for cashiers and location-based transaction tracking.

### Cashier Timesheets

Track cashier shifts with clock in/out functionality, configurable timesheet validation for bill creation, auto-close timesheets, and shift-based reporting.

### Item and Pricing Management

Manage billable healthcare services, configure item prices with price history tracking, and integrate with OpenMRS Stock Management module.

### Billing Exemptions

Configure automated billing exemptions based on patient attributes with support for age-based, location-based, and custom exemption rules.

### Financial Reports

Generate shift summary reports, daily shift summaries, department collections, department revenue, and payments by payment mode reports.

### Order Integration

Automatically generate bills from clinical orders with order-to-bill line item mapping.

### REST API & Integration

Provides REST API endpoints at `/rest/v1/billing/*` for bills, payments, payment modes, billable services, cash points, timesheets, and item prices. Includes patient dashboard integration for OpenMRS 2.x with configurable bill history widget. Supports English, French, and Spanish translations.
